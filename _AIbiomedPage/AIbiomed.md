  This front adapts from our legacy website <a href="http://deepchrome.org/">deepchrome.org</a> and introduces updates of a suite of
    deep learning tools we have developed for learning patterns and making predictions on biomedical data (mostly from functional genomics).
    Please feel free to email me when you find my typos.

## General Background 

Biology and medicine are rapidly becoming data-intensive. A recent comparison of genomics with social media, online videos, and other data-intensive disciplines suggests that genomics alone will equal or surpass other fields in data generation and analysis within the next decade.  The volume and complexity of these data present new opportunities, but also pose new challenges. Data sets are complex, often ill-understood and grow at a a faster scale than computational capabilities.  Problems of this nature may be particularly well-suited to deep learning techniques (see [Opportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2017.0387)). The website  introduces a suite of deep learning tools we have developed for learning patterns and making predictions on biomedical data (mostly from functional genomics).

## Background of Learning: Representation Learning and Deep Learning

The performance of machine learning algorithms is largely dependent on the
 data representation (or features) on which they are
applied. Deep learning aims at discovering learning algorithms that can
find multiple levels of representations directly from data, with higher
levels representing more abstract concepts. In recent years,
the field of deep learning has lead to groundbreaking performance in many applications such as computer vision, speech understanding, natural language processing, and computational biology.

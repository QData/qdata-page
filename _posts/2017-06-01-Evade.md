### Abstract
Machine learning is widely used to develop classifiers for security tasks. However, the robustness of these methods
against motivated adversaries is uncertain. In this work, we
propose a generic method to evaluate the robustness of classifiers
under attack. The key idea is to stochastically manipulate a
malicious sample to find a variant that preserves the malicious
behavior but is classified as benign by the classifier. We present
a general approach to search for evasive variants and report on
results from experiments using our techniques against two PDF
malware classifiers, PDFrate and Hidost. Our method is able to
automatically find evasive variants for both classifiers for all of
the 500 malicious seeds in our study. Our results suggest a general
method for evaluating classifiers used in security applications, and
raise serious doubts about the effectiveness of classifiers based
on superficial features in the presence of adversaries.

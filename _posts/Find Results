   26  ### Abstract:
   27  The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enable a flood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks. Recent literature tried to understand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale chromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning tasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured, high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what are the relevant factors and how they work together? Previous studies either failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an attention-based deep learning approach; we call AttentiveChrome, that uses a unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in human. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention scores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature visualization methods such as saliency map.

   21  ### Abstract:
   22: Computational methods that predict differential gene expression from histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding how histone modifications control the functional heterogeneity of cells through influencing differential gene regulation. Recent studies either failed to capture combinatorial effects on differential prediction or primarily only focused on cell type-specific analysis. In this paper, we develop a novel attention-based deep learning architecture, DeepDiff, that provides a unified and end-to-end solution to model and to interpret how dependencies among histone modifications control the differential patterns of gene regulation. DeepDiff uses a hierarchy of multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the spatial structure of input signals and to model how various histone modifications cooperate automatically. We introduce and train two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling DeepDiff to attend differentially to relevant modifications and to locate important genome positions for each modification. Additionally, DeepDiff introduces a novel deep-learning based multi-task formulation to use the cell-type-specific gene expression predictions as auxiliary tasks, encouraging richer feature embeddings in our primary task of differential expression prediction. Using data from Roadmap Epigenomics Project (REMC) for ten different pairs of cell types, we show that DeepDiff significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines for differential gene expression prediction. The learned attention weights are validated by observations from previous studies about how epigenetic mechanisms connect to differential gene expression. Codes and results are available at [deepchrome.org](deepchrome.org)

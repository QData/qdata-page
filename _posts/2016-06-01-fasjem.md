### Abstract
Estimating multiple sparse Gaussian Graphical
Models (sGGMs) jointly for many related
tasks (large K) under a high-dimensional
(large p) situation is an important task.
Most previous studies for the joint estimation
of multiple sGGMs rely on penalized
log-likelihood estimators that involve expensive
and difficult non-smooth optimizations.
We propose a novel approach, FASJEM for
fast and scalable joint structure-estimation of
multiple sGGMs at a large scale. As the first
study of joint sGGM using the M-estimator
framework, our work has three major contributions:
(1) We solve FASJEM through an
entry-wise manner which is parallelizable. (2)
We choose a proximal algorithm to optimize
FASJEM. This improves the computational
efficiency from O(Kp3
) to O(Kp2
) and reduces
the memory requirement from O(Kp2
)
to O(K). (3) We theoretically prove that FASJEM
achieves a consistent estimation with
a convergence rate of O(log(Kp)/ntot). On
several synthetic and four real-world datasets,
FASJEM shows significant improvements over
baselines on accuracy, computational complexity
and memory costs.

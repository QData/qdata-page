### Abstract
In this paper we introduce a deep neural network architecture to perform information extraction on character-based sequences,
e.g. named-entity recognition on Chinese text or secondary-structure detection on protein sequences. With a task-independent architecture, the
deep network relies only on simple character-based features, which obviates the need for task-specific feature engineering. The proposed discriminative framework includes three important strategies, (1) a deep
learning module mapping characters to vector representations is included
to capture the semantic relationship between characters; (2) abundant
online sequences (unlabeled) are utilized to improve the vector representation through semi-supervised learning; and (3) the constraints of
spatial dependency among output labels are modeled explicitly in the
deep architecture. The experiments on four benchmark datasets have
demonstrated that, the proposed architecture consistently leads to the
state-of-the-art performance.

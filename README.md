# Qdata group webpage 

- Built from [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

- the whole structure of this site is adpated from MM docs [folder](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/docs/)

- two folders are the most imporant from above: 
  + `_page` 
  + `_post`

- I adapt and revise the `_page` by adding our legacy sites / each site with a special `_page` folder to organize their posts. 


- Team, for any  changes you prefer to add, please fork and PR!  Before PR, please make sure everything works fine locally 
  + (Local build via running `bundle exec jekyll serve`)


- ToDo: gallery for member photos
